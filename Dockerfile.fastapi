RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --prefix=/install -r requirements.txt

# Stage 2: Final image
# Use the an optimised version of Linux with Python as the base image.
# This minimizes the final image size by installing dependencies in a temporary stage and copying only the necessary files. ðŸš€

# Classic choice of port for FastAPI. It could be re-wired when starting the container.
EXPOSE 8000

# Why CMD and not ENTRYPOINT?
# CMD is used because it allows flexibilityâ€”if a user wants to override the command (e.g., run a different FastAPI app or shell into the container), they can do so easily. ENTRYPOINT, on the other hand, is more rigid and is typically used when the container should always run a specific executable.
# What does "api.main:api" mean?
# "api.main:api" tells Uvicorn to look for the FastAPI application inside the main.py file within the api package. The first api refers to the folder (api/), main refers to the Python module (main.py), and the second api is the FastAPI instance inside main.py (api = FastAPI()).

# Another note, without "--root-path", "/docs", i.e. Swagger UI, will stop working.
# CMD ["uvicorn", "api.main:api", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000", "--proxy-headers", "--forwarded-allow-ips", "*", "--root-path", "/webservice"]
